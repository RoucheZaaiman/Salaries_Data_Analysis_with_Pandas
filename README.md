# Salaries Data Analysis

I apply fundalmental Pandas coding to the SF Salaries dataset from Kaggle. Some interesting calculations made in this exercise are as follows:
•	Determining the corrolation between 2 columns.
•	Determining how many job titles in 2013 were unique.
•	Determining how many employees have the word 'chief' in their title.
•	Determining the total pay for a specific person.
•	Determining the mean salary for each year.
•	Finding the top 5 most common jobs.

These exercises have been done through Jose Portilla (head of Data Science at Pierian Data Inc.) on Udemy.
