# SF_Salaries_and_Ecommerce_Purchases
In this set of exercises I use basic to intermediate operations and queries in Pandas.  The Ecommerce Purchases and SF Salaries datasets are used.  Basic operations such as finding the number of items in a specific category, a specific purchase or item, filtering data using 1 or more conditions applied to the variables and more complex calculations such as credit cards that expire in a specific year and finding the top 5 email providers of clients that bought at Amazon.  The SF Salaries dataset can be found on Kaggle and the Ecommerce Purchase data is a made up dataset of 10 000 entries, and not real data from Amazon.
